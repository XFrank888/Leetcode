# Leetcode 704. Binary Search

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        while(left <= right){ 
            int middle = (left + right) /2;
            if(nums[middle] > target){
                right = middle - 1;
            } else if(nums[middle] < target){
                left = middle + 1;
            } else{
                return middle;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
Binary search:

Initialize your pointers: You start with two pointers, one at the start of the list (left) and one at the end (right).

Find the midpoint: Calculate the middle index of the list using the formula (left + right) / 2. If left and right are large, this could potentially cause an overflow error. A safer way to compute the middle that doesn't risk overflow is left + (right - left) / 2.

Check the middle element: Compare the element at the middle index with your target value:

If the middle element equals the target, then you've found the target and can return its index.

If the middle element is greater than the target, then the target can only be in the left (lower) half of the list. So, you update the right pointer to be middle - 1.

If the middle element is less than the target, then the target can only be in the right (upper) half of the list. So, you update the left pointer to be middle + 1.

Repeat the process: Continue these steps, recalculating the midpoint, and adjusting the left or right pointer accordingly. You repeat until the left pointer is greater than the right pointer, at which point you know the target isn't in the list, and you can return -1 or some indication that the value was not found.

    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int size = nums.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
            if(nums[i] == val){
                for(int j = i+1; j < size; j++){
                    nums[j - 1] = nums[j];
                }
                i--;
                size--;
            }
        }
        return size;
    }
};
